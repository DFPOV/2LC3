— Homework 6 Notebook 3: Quantification Expansion
[1]
This notebook assumes that you already worked through H6.1 and H6.2, and the set-up here is the same, with the inductive theory of natural numbers preloaded, symmetry and associativity of + and · activated, and “Quantification expansion” enabled, but you are allowed to have up to four hint items per hint.

So calculations as in Homework Notebook 6.1 still work perfectly here:

[2]
Calculation:
    ∑ i : ℕ ❙ 1 ≤ i < 4 • i · i
  =⟨ Quantification expansion ⟩
      (i · i)[i ≔ 1]
    + (i · i)[i ≔ 2]
    + (i · i)[i ≔ 3]
  =⟨ Substitution ⟩
    1 · 1 + 2 · 2 + 3 · 3
  =⟨ Evaluation ⟩
    1 + 4 + 9
  =⟨ Evaluation ⟩
    14

Calculation:
        (∑ i : ℕ ❙ 1 ≤ i < 4 • i · i )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        ((i · i)[i ≔ 1] + (i · i)[i ≔ 2]) + (i · i)[i ≔ 3]
    = ⟨ Substitution ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        (1 · 1 + 2 · 2) + 3 · 3
    = ⟨ Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        (1 + 4) + 9
    = ⟨ Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        14
— CalcCheck: All steps OK
[3]
But here you also can do this in a single step:

[4]
Calculation:
    ∑ i : ℕ ❙ 1 ≤ i < 4 • i · i
  =⟨ Quantification expansion, substitution, evaluation ⟩
    14

Calculation:
        (∑ i : ℕ ❙ 1 ≤ i < 4 • i · i )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        14
— CalcCheck: All steps OK
[5]
For the following examples, you are invited to also try them in a single step, but if you don’t get it checked, you should fall back to making (some) intermediate step(s) explicit again.

You should not need other tools such as a calculator to do any of these.

Write down as many intermediate steps as you consider appropriate for supporting your solution process.

[6]
Calculation:
    ∏ k : ℕ ❙ 0 < k < 6 • k
  =⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
    120

Calculation:
        (∏ k : ℕ ❙ 0 < k < 6 • k )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        120
— CalcCheck: All steps OK
[7]
Calculation:
    ∑ k : ℕ ❙ 1 < k < 7 • 7 - k
  =⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
    15

Calculation:
        (∑ k : ℕ ❙ 1 < k < 7 • 7 - k )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        15
— CalcCheck: All steps OK
[8]
Calculation:
    ∏ k : ℕ ❙ 4 ≤ k < 14 • 12 - k
  =⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
    0

Calculation:
        (∏ k : ℕ ❙ 4 ≤ k < 14 • 12 - k )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        0
— CalcCheck: All steps OK
[9]
Calculation:
    ∑ i, j : ℕ ❙ 3 < i ≤ 6 ∧ 3 ≤ j < 5 • i · j
  =⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
    105 

Calculation:
        (∑ i : ℕ; j : ℕ ❙ 3 < i ≤ 6 ∧ 3 ≤ j < 5 • i · j )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        105
— CalcCheck: All steps OK

The problem that failed to keep young Carl Friedrich Gauss busy for a long time should also fail to keep you busy for a long time (although, if it was set in H6.1, it probably would keep you busy for a while…):

[11]
Calculation:
    ∑ i : ℕ ❙ i ≤ 100 • i
  =⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
    5050

Calculation:
        (∑ i : ℕ ❙ i ≤ 100 • i )
    = ⟨ Quantification expansion, Substitution, Evaluation ⟩
            — CalcCheck: ─ OK
        5050
— CalcCheck: All steps OK
