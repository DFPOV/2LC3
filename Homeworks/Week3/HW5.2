— Homework 5 Notebook 2: Calculations with Monotonicity and Antitonicity
[1]
The equational theory of integers is preloaded here, but without activation of automatic associativity and symmetry. Facts are available here, but not Evaluation.

Here you have also the following theorems available:

“≤-Monotonicity of +”:            a ≤ b  ⇒  a + d ≤ b + d

“≤-Antitonicity of unary minus”:  a ≤ b  ⇒    - b ≤   - a

“≤-Monotonicity of -”:            a ≤ b  ⇒  a - d ≤ b - d
“≤-Antitonicity of -”:            c ≤ b  ⇒  a - b ≤ a - c
First a demonstration of how these are used:

Now “fill-in-the-blanks”: In the following calculation chain, replace each hint item “?₁” with an appropriate hint item, that is (for now),

either a theorem name or theorem number from the list of integer theorems here,
or the keyword Substitution,
or “Fact `expr`” for some expression expr (this is accepted only where expr could by evaluated to true by Evaluation),
or with “mon with hi” where “mon” is one of the monotonicity or antitonicity theorem names listed above, and “hi” is a hint item.
Being aware of the associating conventions governing _+_ and _-_ is essential for getting this right.

As usual, make no other changes besides replacing “?₁”!
