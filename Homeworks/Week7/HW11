— Homework 11: Some Properties of Relation Operations in Set Theory
[1]
In addition to propositional and predicate logic, preloaded here are all set theory from Ref6.1, and the Cartesian product and relations material from H10.1–H10.3.

For making the proofs more explicit, only one hint item per hint is allowed here. (Structured hint items built using with still count as single hint items.)

Basic properties of Dom are mostly simple set theoretic exercises. The following two have been discussed in the lecture.

Dom distributes over union:

  Using “Set extensionality”:
    For any `x`:
        x ∈ Dom (R ∪ S)
      ≡⟨ “Membership in `Dom`” ⟩
        ∃ y • x ⦗ R ∪ S ⦘ y  
      ≡⟨ “Relation union”⟩
        ∃ y • (x ⦗ R ⦘ y ∨ x ⦗ S ⦘ y)
      ≡⟨ “Distributivity of ∃ over ∨” ⟩
        (∃ y • x ⦗ R ⦘ y) ∨ (∃ y • x ⦗ S ⦘ y) 
      ≡⟨ “Membership in `Dom`”⟩

Calling all brothers…
[32]
The free variables of the following two theorem statements are intended to have the following types:

    R : A ↔ B
    S : A ↔ C
(I could have put those into additional explicit universal quantifiers…)

All bound variables are named accordingly.

Once you can calculate, start from the right…
