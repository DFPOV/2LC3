— Homework 10 Notebook 2: Cartesian Product of Sets
[1]
Preloaded here is the pair material from H10.1 and all set theory from Reference Notebook 6.1.

[2]
We use _×_ (type \x or \times for this symbol) for Cartesian product of sets only, not for types:

[3]
Declaration: _×_ : set t → set u → set ❰ t , u ❱

Declaration: _×_ : set t → (set u → set ❰ t, u ❱)   
    — CalcCheck: Operator _×_: Associating to the right; precedence 100

Instead of from (14.3) in LADM, we start from the following equivalent, but easier-to-use characterisation of product sets:

Axiom “Membership in ×”:
  p ∈ S × T  ≡  fst p ∈ S ∧ snd p ∈ T

Axiom “Membership in ×”: p ∈ S × T ≡ fst p ∈ S ∧ snd p ∈ T

Theorem (14.4) “Membership in ×”:
    ⟨ x , y ⟩ ∈ S × T  ≡  x ∈ S ∧ y ∈ T
Proof:
    ⟨ x, y ⟩ ∈ S × T
  ≡⟨ “Membership in ×” ⟩
    fst ⟨ x, y ⟩ ∈ S ∧ snd ⟨ x , y ⟩ ∈ T
  ≡⟨ “Definition of `fst`”, “Definition of `snd`” ⟩
    x ∈ S ∧ y ∈ T

Theorem (14.4) “Membership in ×”: ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S × T ≡ x ∈ S ∧ y ∈ T
Proof:
    Calculation for expected goal  `⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S × T ≡ x ∈ S ∧ y ∈ T`:
            ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S × T
        ≡ ⟨ “Membership in ×” ⟩

                — CalcCheck: ─ OK
            fst ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S ∧ snd ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ T
        ≡ ⟨ “Definition of `fst`”, “Definition of `snd`” ⟩
                — CalcCheck: Found “Definition of `fst`”
                — CalcCheck: Found “Definition of `snd`”

Theorem (14.5) “Membership in swapped ×”:
    ⟨ x , y ⟩ ∈ S × T  ≡  ⟨ y , x ⟩ ∈ T × S
Proof:
    ⟨ x , y ⟩ ∈ S × T 
  ≡⟨ “Membership in ×” ⟩
     x ∈ S ∧ y ∈ T
  ≡⟨ “Symmetry of ∧” ⟩
    y ∈ T ∧ x ∈ S
  ≡⟨“Membership in ×”⟩
    ⟨ y, x ⟩ ∈ T × S  

Theorem (14.5) “Membership in swapped ×”: ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S × T ≡ ⟨y, x⟩ ∈ T × S
Proof:
    Calculation for expected goal  `⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S × T ≡ ⟨y, x⟩ ∈ T × S`:
            ⟨x, y⟩ ∈ S × T
        ≡ ⟨ “Membership in ×” ⟩
