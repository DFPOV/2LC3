— Homework 4 Notebook 2: Propositional Calculus
[1]
Preloaded here is the content of LADM chapter 3 up to (3.82).

It is assumed that you will have worked through a decent selection of Exercises 2.4 to 2.6 before working on the current notebook.

Symmetry and associativity of equivalence, disjunction, and conjunction are activated.

Prove the following theorems — where these theorems have numbers, you are only allowed to use theorems with smaller numbers (or theorems occurring before the current theorem in this notebook). (Theorems with larger numbers may still be offered by theorem name completion, but will not be accepted by the proof checker.)

Even though theorem numbers are relevant for which theorems you are allowed to use, you still do not have to refer to theorems by their numbers — it remains preferred that you refer to named theorems by (one of) their names.

(A notebook with this kind of organisation could occur in an exam.)

Only one hint item is allowed per hint.

Each of the theorems here has a proof with at most five steps; many need only two or three steps.

If this particular notebook were given to you in a midterm, you would have about an hour to work on it.

Using the golden rule also works well (and in many different ways) for proving the absorption laws — the first one is particularly brief, starting with the golden rule as definition of conjunction:
